# Skyrim DDS

## Setup

```bash
mise trust mise.toml
mise install
```

At the legacy Windows path limit, ordinary paths can fail as not found. Both tools accept `\\?\C:\...` extended-length paths.

## Metadata

`info` reports dimensions, mip and array counts, normalized DXGI format, topology, and stored alpha mode.

```bash
mise exec -- texdiag.exe info -nologo "<texture.dds>"
```

A newline-delimited path list produces the same report:

```bash
mise exec -- texdiag.exe info -nologo -flist "<dds-paths.txt>"
```

A file-list run stops at the first path that cannot be loaded.
Legacy FourCC formats are normalized to DXGI names, such as DXT1 to `BC1_UNORM` and DXT5 to `BC3_UNORM`; the original header form is not reported.
`alpha mode` is DDS metadata; `Unknown` does not mean decoded alpha is absent.

## Channel analysis

`analyze` reports decoded channel statistics for each array item and mip.

```bash
mise exec -- texdiag.exe analyze -nologo "<texture.dds>"
```

`Variance` is an unnormalized sum of squared deviations; `Std Dev` is its square root. Population variance is `Variance / pixel count`.
The fourth component of each channel tuple is decoded alpha. DDS does not encode its Skyrim shader meaning.

## PNG preview

`texconv` decodes the top mip at its stored dimensions to PNG without modifying the DDS.
The output directory must exist. Without `-y`, an existing output file is not replaced.

```bash
mise exec -- texconv.exe -nologo -ft png -m 1 -o "<output-directory>" "<texture.dds>"
```

`--swizzle aaa1` copies decoded alpha to RGB and makes the PNG opaque:

```bash
mise exec -- texconv.exe -nologo -ft png -m 1 --swizzle aaa1 -sx _alpha -o "<output-directory>" "<texture.dds>"
```

PNG represents only the first face or item of a cubemap or array. It is an 8-bit display view rather than a lossless representation of floating-point or HDR data.
